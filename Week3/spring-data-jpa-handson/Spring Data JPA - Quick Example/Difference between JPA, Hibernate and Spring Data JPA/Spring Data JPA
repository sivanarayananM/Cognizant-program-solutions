What it is: A Spring project that simplifies JPA.

What it does: Provides abstractions on top of JPA/Hibernate to make working with databases easier:

Auto-generates repository implementations at runtime.

Lets you write interfaces only â€” no need to write EntityManager code.

Adds JpaRepository, CrudRepository interfaces.

Supports query methods by method naming (findByEmail, findByCountryCode).

How it works: Under the hood, Spring Data JPA uses JPA + your chosen JPA provider (like Hibernate).
